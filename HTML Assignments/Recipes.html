            <li>Instructions</li>
            <ul>
                <p>Step 1 - Chop all the veggies and make almond-cashew paste
                    To prepare this creamy shahi paneer recipe, chop the onion, green chillies, tomatoes along with ginger and coriander leaves separately. Now in a bowl, add the curd and whisk it well. If you are in a hurry, you can also use tomato puree instead of chopped tomatoes. To make this recipe more delicious, you can dry roast the spices separately and then add them to the gravy. This will make your recipe more aromatic. Now, grind cashews and almonds separately using a little water and make cashew and almond paste. Keep them aside until required.</p>
                <p>Step 2 - Prepare onion-tomato gravy using curd
                    Next, put a pan on medium flame and heat 3 tbsps of ghee in it. Add the chopped onions, ginger, green chillies along with green cardamoms for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes. Then, add the beaten curd, cook for another 5 minutes and pour a cup of water into the pan. Cook for another 2 minutes. When the gravy is cooked, let it cool down at room temperature. When it's cool enough, add it to a mixer jar and blend till smooth and keep aside.</p>
                <p>Step 3 - Add paneer cubes in the gravy and cook for 3-5 minutes
                    Now, heat the remaining ghee in another pan and add the ground gravy in it along with red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cashew and almond paste along with salt. Bring it to a boil or till the gravy thickens. Then add the paneer cubes and milk. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. While the gravy is being cooked, cut the paneer into cubes and keep it aside till required. Take two cubes and grate them for garnishing.</p>
                
                <p>Step 4 - Garnish and serve
                    Garnish this delicious North Indian paneer recipe with chopped coriander leaves and grated paneer. If you like it creamier, you can add some fresh cream. This will not only make your dish look appetising but at the same time, it will add to the taste. Serve hot with roomali roti or naan and enjoy!</p>

                <ul>
                   <p>Step 1 - Chop the veggies
                    Firstly, chop all the veggies like onion, carrot, capsicum, cauliflower, baby corn, beans into small pieces and set them aside. Also, chop the paneer into small cubes.</p>
               
                    <p>Step 2 - The prepration
                        Heat oil in a pan. Add asafoetida, cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Let them splutter for a minute. Now add chopped onion and saute them for a few minutes until they turn golden. Now add all the veggies like carrot, capsicum, cauliflower, baby corn, beans and peas.</p>

                    <p>Step 3 - Add the spices
                        Add salt, red chilli powder, dry mango powder, coriander powder, turmeric and give a nice mix. Now add 1/4 cup water. This will prevent the veggies from becoming too dry and will produce steam which will quickly cook the veggies. Cover the pan with a lid for 6-8 minutes.</p>
